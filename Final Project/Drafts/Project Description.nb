Improving the Notebook Archive - Templates and Checks for Computational Essays
Computational essays are an extremely powerful method of exposition: they \
offer the ability to tell an interesting, interactive, and precise scientific \
narrative. The ideal computational essay is written to convey a scientific \
message with the audience in mind, and contains a mixture of code, text, and \
other supporting visual elements. Currently, the notebook archive \
(https://notebookarchive.org/) contains many computational essays and other \
less structured notebooks without a defined style or guidelines for their \
submission.
This aim of this project is to:
1. Develop a test framework for submissions and existing notebooks on the \
Notebook Archive. Some examples of tests that could be done include checks \
for: empty notebooks, broken links, spelling errors, profanity, correct \
notebook magnification and window size etc.
2. Create a a basic machine-readable template, allowing for additional \
automated checks to be performed on a notebook archive submission. This would \
aim to be similar in nature to the function repository template, where the \
author can receive feedback on their notebook in real-time, and ideally see \
the feedback with an inline notebook cell. Checks that could be performed on \
such a template could include: feedback for code-text ratio, missing author \
information, and suggestions against large blocks of code or text.\

Message to riccardo:
- Check for spelling errors
- Check for profanities (depending on language?)
- Report on obsolete functions
-check for $Missing, $Failed
- Put nb at Magnification->100
- Put nb window size/position to Automatic


Notes from night of June 2019:
The big thing about the notebook archive, is that they are essentially saying \
that after you submit your notebook, it will keep working and stay on the web. 
Philosophy for the function repository is that you write first, then check \
later. It only complains after you use the check function.\
