Improving the Notebook Archive - Templates and Checks for Computational Essays
Computational essays are an extremely powerful method of exposition: they \
offer the ability to tell an interesting, interactive, and precise scientific \
narrative. The ideal computational essay is written to convey a scientific \
message with the audience in mind, and contains a mixture of code, text, and \
other supporting visual elements. Currently, the notebook archive \
(https://notebookarchive.org/) contains many computational essays and other \
less structured notebooks without a defined style or guidelines for their \
submission.
This aim of this project is to:
1. Develop a test framework for submissions and existing notebooks on the \
Notebook Archive. Some examples of tests that could be done include checks \
for: empty notebooks, broken links, spelling errors, profanity, correct \
notebook magnification and window size etc.
2. Create a a basic machine-readable template, allowing for additional \
automated checks to be performed on a notebook archive submission. This would \
aim to be similar in nature to the function repository template, where the \
author can receive feedback on their notebook in real-time, and ideally see \
the feedback inline in an inline notebook cell. Checks that could be \
performed on such a template could include: feedback for code-text ratio, \
missing author information, and suggestions against large blocks of code or \
text.\
